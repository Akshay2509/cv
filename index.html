        ("strong" >>> "b")      it's alternative is "i" tag that does the the same but it only make text italicized. but "em" makes text looks strees so it;s better to use "em" instesd of "i" tag.
                                similar to "strong " and "b" basically both are used for make text bold. "b" tag only makes text bold but "strong text makes text text bold and tells browser render it as strong point and vibe. so instesd of "b" use "strong" tag. -->
